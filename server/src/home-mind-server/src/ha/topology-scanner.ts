 * The layout is fetched in two steps, because one call cannot be made to fit.

 * Home Assistant caps a template render at 262 144 characters. The old single
 * template asked for every area's full entity list, and `area_entities()`
 * returns everything — config knobs, diagnostics, the lot — so a large house
 * blows the cap and the whole layout is lost (home-mind#34: 9 059 entities,
 * about 283 KB of JSON). Filtering by domain inside the template helps but does
 * not fix it: the same house still renders around 186 KB, so a slightly bigger
 * one fails again. Only a bounded number of areas per call is actually safe.
 *
 * Step one asks for the shape of the home — floors and areas, names and ids, and
 * how many entities each area holds. Counts rather than ids, so it stays small
 * however large the house; the count is what lets the scan log keep reporting
 * how much the filter saved, which is a running cost worth seeing.

 *
 * How good a proxy, measured against the registry of a 7,612-entity install:
 * of the entities this list drops, 80 % are genuinely `config`/`diagnostic`.
 * It is not a substitute, though — an `entity_category` filter would drop
 * about twice as many, because `sensor` and `switch` are full of diagnostic
 * entities the domain cannot tell apart from real ones. If this ever moves to
 * the websocket registry, filter on the category and delete this list.
 *
 * `automation` is left out for a different reason: an automation belongs to no
 * room, and driving automations is a separate feature this server does not have.
